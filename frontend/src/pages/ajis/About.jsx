              <i>Asian Journal of Insect Science</i> is a peer-reviewed
              international journal published by the{" "}
              <b>Philippine Coleopterists Society Incorporated</b>, dedicated to
              publishing high-quality papers on any aspect of systematic
              entomology, with a preference for scientific papers dealing with
              species from megadiverse countries. Majorly of the megadiverse
              countries are now facing a very fast extinction rate and
              degradation of their ecosystems; hence, research work on these
              countries should also cope with this challenge. It is only a
              matter of time before the species around the world go extinct,
              even before they are documented.{" "}
              <i>Asian Journal of Insect Science</i> considers scientific papers
              on all orders under Class Insecta, both living and fossil, with
              special consideration to papers describing new species to science.
              Other types of systematic papers are considered, including but not
              limited to catalogs, checklists, larval development, insect
              ecology, ontogeny, biographies, bibliographies, biogeography, and
              phylogeny. All PDF versions of currently published issues can be
              accessed freely and free of charge. All copyrights remain with the

                  The core of our journal lies in the quality of our review

                  information is accurate and ethical. The review process must
                  be fair and free from personal attacks, adversarial,
                  prejudice, or conflicts of interest. Reviewers having a

                  journal follows a double-blind review process, we respect

                  As an adjudicator, the editor provides a healthy discourse

                  on any personal connections. When the editor is the author or

                  to manage the review process of his/her manuscript. More
                  importantly, editors must avoid editing a piece of information
