                our beetle species. We are open to various forms of sponsorship.

              <p className="text-md leading-relaxed">
                We also work with philanthropists whose personal endowment fund
                can be used to support the scientific activities of the
                organization. This includes, but is not limited to, support in
                fieldwork activities, support for laboratory works, and, in
                turn, the funder can have a species named after his/her liking,
                as long as it follows the convention of the International Code
                of Zoological Nomenclature, <a className="" href="https://code.iczn.org/." target="_blank">https://code.iczn.org/.</a> The terms of

                students in both undergraduate and graduate programs who will
                focus on the study of Philippine coleopterology. The terms of
